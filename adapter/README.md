# Adapter

Getting the interface you want from the interface you have

Same as in power adapter
* Electrical devices have differenct power(interface) requirements
    - Voltage (5V, 220V)
    - Socket/plug type (Europe, UK, USA)
* We canot modify our gadgets to support every possible interface
    - Some support possible (e.g., 120/220V)
* Thus, we use a special device (an adapter) to give us the interface we require from the interface we have

Adapter - A construct which adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y.
You write an extra piece of code to make that possible.
